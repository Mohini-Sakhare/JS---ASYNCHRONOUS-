1. JavaScript Callbacks
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

A function can accept another function as a parameter.
Callbacks allow one function to call another at a later time.
A callback function can execute after another function has finished.

function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
    callback();
}

function sayBye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Mohini", sayBye);

output:-
Hello, Mohini 
Goodbye!

2. JavaScript Promise :-
JavaScript Promises make handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file loading, or time delays easier. Think of a Promise as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. It can be in one of three states

Pending: The task is in the initial state.
Fulfilled: The task was completed successfully, and the result is available.
Rejected: The task failed, and an error is provided.
Here is an example Promise to check if a number is even. If yes, it resolves; otherwise, it rejects.

let checkEven = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let number = 4;
    if (number % 2 === 0) resolve("The number is even!");
    else reject("The number is odd!");
});
checkEven
    .then((message) => console.log(message)) // On success
    .catch((error) => console.error(error)); // On failure

output:-
The number is even!

3. Async and Await in JavaScript
Async and Await in JavaScript are used to simplify handling asynchronous operations using promises. By enabling asynchronous code to appear synchronous, they enhance code readability and make it easier to manage complex asynchronous flows.

async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();

output:-
{"userId":1,"id":1,"title":"sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit","body":"quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"}

Syntax:
async function functionName() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncFunction();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
}

* Async Function :-
The async function allows us to write promise-based code as if it were synchronous. This ensures that the execution thread is not blocked. Async functions always return a promise. If a value is returned that is not a promise, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise.
Syntax:

async function myFunction() {
  return "Hello";
}

const getData = async () => {
    let data = "Hello World";
    return data;
}

getData().then(data => console.log(data));

output:-
Hello World

Await Keyword
The await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve. It can only be used within an async block. Await makes the code wait until the promise returns a result, allowing for cleaner and more manageable asynchronous code.
const getData = async () => {
    let y = await "Hello World";
    console.log(y);
}

console.log(1);
getData();
console.log(2);
